=================================================================
Aspects Most Applicable to Our Codebase:
- Adopting snake_case for functions and variables, and CamelCase for class names
- Organizing imports into standard library, third-party, and local modules, each separated by a blank line
- Limiting lines to 79 characters ensures better readability

Aspects Most Useful/Appreciated by Devos:
- Proper spacing around operators and after commas makes the code more readable
- Maintain uniform indentation
- Refrain from using wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *)

File and Line Reference:
- In utils/data_processing.py, line 42 is updated from:
**def processData(data):**
to:
**def process_data(data):**
This change aligns with PEP 8's recommendation for function names to be in snake_case, enhancing consistency and readability.
